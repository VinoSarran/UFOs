# UFOs

## Overview and Purpose
Use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to construct a webpage that filtes UFO sighting data according to user selection across these combination of categories: date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
Upon visiting the page, users will see all the available data with roswell data pre-filled as a guide on how the page operates.

As the user enters criteria the data will narrow and pinpoint exactly what the user desires.

## Summary
### Drawbacks:
Here are some shortcomings of  the website: 

1) The User has to view the data before they can accurately fill in their selection.  Case-sensitivity and space will create annoyance and at times missing data.   
2) The website assumes the user will understand how the site works.  No instructions

### Recommendations:

1) Use drop down lists instead of free form to remove burden of matching format
2) Leverage google mapping from API module to show a map of selection
3) Provide a Go/Search button so user interfers that feilds are meant to be filled in
