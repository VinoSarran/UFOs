## Summary
### Webpage Drawbacks:
There are a few drawbacks in the design of the webpage that need to be addressed: 

1) Case-sensitive search field: the webpage makes use of case sensitive search terms. This possess an issue since there are no instructions to users for how they should enter their filter terms in the search field. This should be resolved by allowing more flexibility in the search term lookups. 
2) Whitespaces: whitespaces also affect the search results. This should be resolved in case the user was to mistakenly enter whitespace after their search term. 

### Design Recommendations:
There are a few recommendations that can be made to improve the overall design of the webpage:

1) Live Data: the webpage would offer more interactivity if it were to include live data for users to search for the latest UFO sightings.
2) Sighting Map: The webpage would offer more interactivity and visual appeal if the data were plotted on a map for users to visually see the counts of UFO sightings. The mapping of UFO data would also be affected by the filter search fields.
